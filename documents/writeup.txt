Describe the required features you have implemented, and which you have not.
if you have missing features, be sure to explain how much you accomplished.
You should detail anything you think we need to know to understand your code.

I COMMENTED MY CODE VERY WELL
PLEASE READ IT :) :) :)
(sory, i have 6 mins left before deadline!)

	general idea:
	used a winged edge algorithm, instead of predecessors and successors i 
	had 2 faces, left and right, which in turn had pointers to the 3 edges
	they were part of. Using these two structures, I looped around them and
	created the odd or even vertices.
	MY PROBLEM:
	it only does one subdivision before crashing because not all triangles get
	created
	Textures work fine, unless im subdiving (where my problem is :( )
